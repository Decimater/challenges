Hex Converting Visualisation

Your task is to write a method showHexConversion, that takes a decimal number
and gives Back the output, how you can calculate the corresponding hexadecimal
number as a String.

Example: showHexConversion(1000)
Returnstring:1000/16=62 R 8\n 62/16= 3 R 14\n 3/16= 0 R 3\nResult=3E8
Visualized:
1000/16=62 R    8
      62/16=   3 R 14
         3/16=   0 R    3
Result=3E8

Every line but the last ends with "\n"
Whitespaces to format it nice (take a look at the example testcase String)
The method only needs to be able to convert positiv numbers
